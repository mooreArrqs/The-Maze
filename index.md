>> Developer's story

My experience with engaging in a game time is usually through my mobile device when I have the time to spare and looking for a leisure activity.

This project is part of my portfolio to showcase my skills and dedication to game development and I find delight to be part of its development.

Topics on self-development and finding work-life balance are of interest to me. The art of managing one's time effectively, meaning you prioritize importants tasks for day's work and still manage to find the time to engage in fun activities, such as in this case playing a game fuels me fondly.

Which is where the idea of developing The Maze game came about.

PS. Playing mobiles games has been my fun activity adventure I get to do with my Mom.
